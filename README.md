# MJN — iMaJiN Network Protocol

**今人 — ima jin — "now person"**

MJN is an open protocol for sovereign human presence on the internet. It carries identity, attribution, consent, and value natively — at the protocol layer.

HTTP moved documents. TCP/IP moved packets. Neither carried the human. MJN does.

## The Four Primitives

| Primitive | What it carries |
|-----------|----------------|
| **DID** | Sovereign identity — cryptographically yours, not platform-issued |
| **.fair** | Attribution manifest — who made this, in what proportion, on what terms |
| **Consent** | Explicit, signed, machine-readable — not buried in terms of service |
| **Settlement** | Automatic value distribution — no platform in the middle |

## Read the Spec

→ [RFC-0001: MJN Core Specification](rfcs/RFC-0001-mjn-core.md)

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation is maintained by [imajin.ai](https://imajin.ai).

- Code: [github.com/ima-jin/imajin-ai](https://github.com/ima-jin/imajin-ai)
- Live: auth.imajin.ai · profile.imajin.ai · registry.imajin.ai · chat.imajin.ai
- First demonstration: April 1st, 2026

The reference implementation is one node among many. It does not define the protocol. The RFCs define the protocol.

---

## Governance

MJN is governed by the MJN Foundation, a Swiss *Stiftung* currently in formation. The Foundation holds the protocol specification, operates the RFC process, and governs token issuance under Swiss FINMA guidelines.

No entity — including imajin.ai and the MJN Foundation — has unilateral authority to modify an accepted RFC.
